# flutter_workshop
## Preparation
### SDK
You’ll need the Flutter SDK as well as Android and iOS to be prepared.

If you wish to run the app on only one OS that’s fine. In this case you won’t need to set up both. Be aware that you need a Mac machine for creating an iOS app.

### IDE
There are basically two alternatives: Android Studio/IntelliJ or Visual Studio Code. Choose what you like.

Additionally, you need to install the Flutter and Dart plugins.
